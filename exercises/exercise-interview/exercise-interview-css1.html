        <b>
        You’ve written that you grew up with your mother’s library, reading Richard Wright and Langston Hughes. When you began to choose books on your own, what were you drawn to?
        </b>
      </P>

      <P>
      I love and I always have loved history books. I love the history. So, I read Mommy’s, which also contained a lot of history, but I also read Charles Darwin, and I was interested in the development of the Constitution. It seemed like, “This is something we ought to know.” I grew up thinking, “I’ll be a lawyer.” If you grew up admiring those kinds of things, you’re going to end up looking at the world a little differently.

        <b>
        Your poems acknowledge complicated histories as part of sensuality, as part of dreaming, as part of topics that are seen as more emotive. How do you think about contextualizing, or adding that history, within your process?
        </b>
      </P>

      <P>
        What I’m always trying to look at is, <span class="highlight">“Did this really happen, and who was saying that it did happen?”</span> That fool for the President who talks about fake news—he’s been the liar, because when we look at what the United States has stood for, we cannot ignore the people who came here, whether they wanted to or not—whether they were the enslaved, who were brought over here against their will, or whether they are immigrants coming from Syria, Afghanistan, or [other] places of war. Look at World War II. And you look at the people who tried to come over, and the United States turned the Jewish people down, because we didn’t want them.
      </P><P>
        So when you hear, “What is the history?” Then you have to say, “And who said it?” So some things didn’t make sense. Some things I rejected. When I was growing up, it didn’t make sense that Hitler would be allowed to say what he said about the Jewish people and to murder them, and that the United States would not open our doors to them. We ended up in the war, but we should have opened our doors.
      </P><P>
        But then, while World War II was going on, we still had segregation. So what kind of sense did that make? My generation looked at it, and as you know, we’re going to be the generation that’s going to fight against segregation, because it didn’t make sense.
      </P><P>
        You look at the world you live in, and then you start to ask yourself, “What makes sense?” We’re living with that fool in the White House, and it doesn’t make sense that he’s dropping bombs on people. It was just Easter, and one of the people who helped Jesus carry the cross was Simon, the Cyrene. We’re dropping bombs on Syria, yet we claim to be Christians.
      </P>

      <P>
        <b>
          A recent poem of yours in the Oxford American,”The Blues,” seemed like a kind of sense-making in itself—a way to say very clearly, “Here is the history of what you are seeing; here is the history of what you are hearing.” In your writing, is that something that you are looking for, the sense-making of it?
        </b>
      </P>
      <P>
        I’m looking at things that are there and saying, “What makes sense?” I’ve been teasing the gentlemen lately, because there’s been so much raping going on. I said, “If these things continue to happen, the penis is going to become extinct.” And the guys are like, “Oh my god!”
      </P><P>
        Every organ that human beings have that has been misused, we’ve gotten rid of. We don’t have tonsils anymore. We don’t have the sixth finger anymore. We don’t have the sixth toe anymore. We have evolved beyond these things, because they didn’t make sense. If men don’t learn to use their penis properly, we’re going to lose the penis, because it doesn’t make sense.
      </P><P>
        So somebody said, “Well, what will we do to mate? How will we go forward with mating?” That, I don’t know. But I do know that Mother Nature takes things that don’t make sense away from us. We’ve got a history of that.
      </P><P>
        I deal with the world as I see it, so I’ve only written, if I’m not mistaken, one poem about rape. Other people have done better jobs. But, except me, I don’t think anybody has written anything about the extinction of the penis.
      </P>

      <P>
        <b>
        Is there anything in your process that stays constant from day to day? Do have routines that you return to when everything else allows for variation?
        </b>
      </P>
      <P>
          The one thing that’s consistent in my work is that I try to make sense. I do have a sense of humor. If anybody were ever criticizing my work, they would see that I laugh a lot at us—us being people—and with us, because a lot of stuff we do is just crazy, so I get a big kick out of that.
        </P><P>
          When I was much younger, I was, of course, much angrier. I’m a lot less interested in that kind of anger now. It’s because, and again, as Bonnie Raitt teaches us, you know, “Life gets mighty precious when there’s less of it to bear.” I’m 73. I’m not going to spend my time being angry with some fool over something that doesn’t make sense. What I’m going to do is go on about my business.

        <h2>Some Things</h2>
        Nikki Giovanni recommends:

      <ul>
        <li>I think that one thing that you would love to do, which I did several times, is take a train ride across the United States. I think that that’s just wonderful; that’s just a wonderful thing to do.
          </li>
        <li>Everybody has to go to Paris. I don’t care who bombs it. I don’t care what happens, you have to go to Paris. Because it’s Paris dammit and you have to go.
          </li>
        <li>I think that it would be good to take the Freedom Trail at some point. For everybody, black and white. I think that that’s important to see how we evolved.
          </li>
        <li>You need to eat one thing that you never thought you would eat. I don’t care what it is. I don’t think that I would eat dog, because dogs are our friends. But I think that, you know, you have to eat that one, to get to go some place and try that one thing that you haven’t tried.
          </li>
        <li>And I think it’s good just to fall in love. You know, recognizing it’s not going to last. But, you know, fall in love.
          </li>
      </ul>
